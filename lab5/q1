*/Task 1:
Design a C++ class named PetrolPump to manage fuel transactions. Implement a static data
member called pricePerLiter (e.g., 270.50 PKR) to store the uniform rate for all transactions
across all pump objects. Include non-static members for pumpID and litersFilled, and write a
simple non-static member function, printReceipt(), that calculates and displays the total
amount due using the shared static price.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class PetrolPump {
private:
    int pumpID;
    double litersFilled;
public:
    static double pricePerLiter;

    PetrolPump(int id, double liters) : pumpID(id), litersFilled(liters) {}

    void printReceipt() {
        double total = litersFilled * pricePerLiter;
        cout << "Pump ID: " << pumpID << endl;
        cout << "Liters Filled: " << litersFilled << endl;
        cout << "Price per Liter: " << pricePerLiter << endl;
        cout << "Total Amount: " << total << endl;
    }
};

double PetrolPump::pricePerLiter = 270.50;

int main() {
    PetrolPump p1(101, 20.5);
    PetrolPump p2(102, 15);

    p1.printReceipt();
    cout << endl;
    p2.printReceipt();

    return 0;
}
